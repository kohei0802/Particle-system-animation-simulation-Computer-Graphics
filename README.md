# Physical simulation of a particle system (Computer Graphics)

My solution to Games101 Exercise 8

- Used semi-implicit Euler method to simulate a blue colored rope
- Used Verlet method with damping to simulate a green colored rope.

# Finding
- Explicit Euler method was too unstable that the particles moved chaotically.
- Simply adding damping forces did not work with semi-implicit Euler method (not sure why).
